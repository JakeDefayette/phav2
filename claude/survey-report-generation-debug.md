# Survey Report Generation Debug Session

## Issue Description
When users complete the multi-step survey form and click "Generate Report", nothing happens. The button appears to be non-functional with no visible feedback or errors.

## Investigation Summary

### What We've Discovered

#### ✅ Working Components
1. **Survey Form Rendering** - The multi-step form displays correctly with all three steps
2. **Client-side Validation** - Form validation schemas are properly configured
3. **API Endpoints Structure** - Both `/api/assessment/start` and `/api/assessment/[id]/submit` exist
4. **Environment Variables** - Supabase credentials are properly set in `.env.local`
5. **Basic Server Functionality** - Health endpoint returns healthy status

#### ❌ Root Issue Identified
**Database Schema Mismatch**: The code expects a `content` column in the `reports` table, but the database schema cache shows it doesn't exist.

**Error Message**: 
```
"Failed to generate report: Could not find the 'content' column of 'reports' in the schema cache"
```

### Technical Details

#### API Testing Results
```bash
# Assessment creation works
✅ POST /api/assessment/start - Success (creates user, child, assessment)

# Assessment submission fails on report generation
❌ POST /api/assessment/[id]/submit - Fails with schema error
```

#### Database Connection Status
- ✅ Basic connection established (can create users/assessments)
- ❌ Supabase health check shows "unhealthy" status
- ❌ Schema cache appears outdated or incomplete

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Form Debugging
**File**: `src/features/assessment/components/MultiStepSurveyForm/MultiStepSurveyForm.tsx`
- Added comprehensive logging to form submission handler
- Added explicit validation check before final submission
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### 2. Fixed Type Import Issues
**File**: `src/app/api/assessment/[id]/submit/route.ts`
- Added missing `GeneratedReportContent` type import
- Fixed recommendations data structure to match component expectations

### 3. Improved Checkbox Integration
**File**: `src/features/assessment/components/MultiStepSurveyForm/MultiStepSurveyForm.tsx`
- Added `name` prop to Formik checkbox fields for proper integration
- Enhanced validation error display

## Next Steps Required

### Priority 1: Database Schema Verification
1. **Initialize SupabaseMCP** (as mentioned by user)
2. **Verify Reports Table Schema**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if content column exists
   SELECT column_name, data_type 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'reports' AND table_schema = 'public';
   ```

3. **Run Missing Migrations** if needed:
   - The migration files show `content jsonb NOT NULL` should exist
   - Migration `002_create_core_tables.sql` line 116 defines the column
   - May need to run: `npm run migrate` or manual SQL execution

### Priority 2: Fix Schema Cache Issue
- Restart Supabase connection/clear cache
- Verify all migration files have been applied
- Check for any schema conflicts or partial migrations

### Priority 3: Complete End-to-End Testing
Once schema is fixed:
1. Test complete survey submission flow
2. Verify report generation works
3. Test report page rendering
4. Validate PDF download functionality

## Files Modified
- `src/features/assessment/components/MultiStepSurveyForm/MultiStepSurveyForm.tsx`
- `src/app/api/assessment/[id]/submit/route.ts`
- Created debugging scripts: `test-api.sh`, `check-schema.js`

## Test Data for Verification
When ready to test, use:
```javascript
{
  childData: {
    firstName: "Test",
    lastName: "Child",
    dateOfBirth: "2015-01-01",
    gender: "male"
  },
  parentData: {
    firstName: "Test", 
    lastName: "Parent",
    email: "unique@example.com",
    phone: "123-456-7890"
  }
}
```

## Current State
- Form submission logic is correct but blocked by database schema issue
- All client-side code appears functional
- API endpoints are responding but failing on report creation
- Database connection works for basic operations but fails on reports table

**Resume Point**: Initialize SupabaseMCP and verify/fix the reports table schema, specifically the `content` column availability.
