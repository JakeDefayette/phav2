# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Dynamic Report Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to generate personalized PDF reports from survey responses for online use.
# Details:
Use React-PDF (v2+) or PDFKit for dynamic online PDF generation. Map survey responses to visual charts and diagrams. Integrate practice branding. Focus on optimizing for online report generation and delivery.

# Test Strategy:
Test online report generation with various survey inputs. Verify branding, visual elements, and online delivery performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. PDF Library Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and install a suitable PDF generation library (e.g., Adobe PDF Services SDK, Jaspersoft, UniDoc) and configure API credentials or dependencies as required.
### Details:
Ensure the library supports required features such as dynamic content, chart embedding, and branding. Validate installation by generating a simple test PDF.
<info added on 2025-05-27T16:58:25.224Z>
The PDF library setup is now complete. We've selected React-PDF (@react-pdf/renderer) for its excellent React integration and comprehensive PDF generation capabilities. Additional dependencies include Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 for future chart rendering needs.

A new file, src/services/pdf.tsx, has been created with a comprehensive PDF service. The service is implemented as a singleton PDFService class with methods for client-side and server-side PDF generation, download link creation, data validation, size estimation, and testing.

Key features implemented include professional PDF styling with Helvetica font family, responsive layout, practice branding support, patient information section, Brain-O-Meter score display, summary section, assessment details by category, recommendations section, and footer with report metadata.

The service integrates seamlessly with existing Report and ReportWithShares types, is exported through the services barrel file, and a test API endpoint has been created at /api/test-pdf.

Validation tests have confirmed successful TypeScript compilation, proper functioning of the PDF generation test endpoint, correct service export and accessibility. The library is now ready for integration with report data and subsequent tasks such as survey data mapping and chart rendering.

## 2. Survey Data Mapping [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Design and implement logic to map raw survey data into structured formats suitable for report generation, including tables, summaries, and visual elements.
### Details:
Define data schemas and transformation rules to convert survey responses into report-ready data structures. Handle missing or malformed data gracefully.
<info added on 2025-05-27T16:59:44.369Z>
Implementation plan for Survey Data Mapping:

1. Create `SurveyDataMapper` service:
   - Transform raw responses into report-ready structures
   - Implement category-based grouping and aggregation
   - Add data validation and error handling for malformed responses
   - Create type-specific value processors for different question types
   - Generate summary statistics and insights
   - Integrate with existing ReportsService

2. Key features to implement:
   - Type-safe data transformation based on question types
   - Category-based response grouping
   - Statistical aggregation (averages, percentages, counts)
   - Missing data handling
   - Validation and sanitization
   - Brain-o-meter score calculation integration

3. Data structure analysis:
   - Survey responses stored in `survey_responses` table with flexible `response_value` (JSON) field
   - Question definitions in `survey_question_definitions` with types: 'multiple_choice', 'text', 'number', 'boolean', 'scale', 'date'
   - Questions organized by categories (attention, behavior, etc.)
   - Reports expect structured content in JSONB format with child info, assessment data, categories, and summary

Ensure the implementation handles various question types, performs necessary data transformations, and produces a structured JSONB output compatible with the existing report generation system.

## 5. Performance Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Optimize the report generation process for speed and resource efficiency, especially for large datasets or concurrent requests.
### Details:
Profile report generation, minimize memory usage, and implement caching or batching strategies where appropriate.
<info added on 2025-05-28T12:41:50.314Z>
Performance analysis completed. Key bottlenecks identified:
1. Lack of caching for report data, including survey responses, chart transformations, and content generation.
2. Inefficient chart generation due to sequential processing, no memoization, and repeated color generation.
3. Large dataset processing issues in SurveyDataMapper, with no streaming or chunking.
4. Absence of performance monitoring for report generation time, chart rendering, and memory usage.

Implementation plan to address these issues:
1. Develop ReportCache service with TTL-based caching.
2. Implement memoization for ChartService transformations.
3. Add lazy loading for chart data.
4. Integrate performance monitoring utilities.
5. Optimize SurveyDataMapper for efficient large dataset handling.
6. Implement memory management strategies for report generation.

These optimizations will significantly improve report generation performance, reduce memory usage, and enable more efficient caching and batching strategies.
