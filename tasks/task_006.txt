# Task ID: 6
# Title: Core Refactoring & Component Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the static demoreport.tsx template into a modular, reusable React component architecture, separating presentational and data logic, and establishing the foundation for dynamic report generation.
# Details:
The core refactoring and component architecture work has been successfully completed, implementing a feature-based organization structure. Key accomplishments include:

- Legacy src/components/ directory removed
- Feature-based structure implemented with src/features/ (assessment, reports, dashboard)
- Shared components moved to src/shared/components/ organized by atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- All services consolidated in src/shared/services/ and feature-specific services
- Types organized in src/shared/types/
- Utils and constants properly structured in src/shared/
- All import paths updated and verified
- TypeScript compilation successful

The new architecture follows best practices:
- Clear separation of concerns between features and shared resources
- Atomic design principles for component organization
- Feature modules are self-contained with their own components, services, hooks
- Shared resources available across all features
- Clean, scalable directory structure

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the feature-based organization is correctly implemented. 2. Ensure all components are properly categorized in the atomic design structure. 3. Confirm that shared resources are accessible across all features. 4. Test TypeScript compilation to ensure type safety. 5. Review import paths to verify they are updated and working correctly. 6. Run unit and integration tests for all components in their new locations. 7. Perform a final code review to ensure adherence to the new architectural structure.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Modularize Existing Template [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the current demoreport.tsx template to identify logical UI sections and data dependencies. Break down the template into modular components, establishing a clear separation between presentational and container components.
### Details:
Map out the structure of the existing template, noting repeated patterns and distinct UI blocks. Propose an initial modular breakdown that will inform atomic design implementation.

## Analysis of Current Demo Report Template Structure

**Key Files Analyzed:**
- `src/app/demo-report/page.tsx` (297 lines) - Current implementation
- `docs/demoreport/demoreport.tsx` (301 lines) - Similar structure
- `src/features/reports/components/report/` - Existing report components

**Current Architecture Analysis:**

### 1. **Page-Level Structure** (Container Components)
- `DemoReportPage()` - Main wrapper with BrandingProvider
- `DemoReportContent()` - Core content component with branding context
- Heavy coupling between UI and business logic

### 2. **Major UI Sections Identified** (Potential Organisms)
- **Report Header** - Brand colors, title, action buttons (Print, Back)
- **Patient Information Block** - Contact details, child/parent info
- **Spinal Assessment Grid** - Two-column layout with diagram + region details
- **Region Details List** - Symptom mappings per spinal region
- **Report Components** - OrganConnections, BrainOMeter, Recommendations
- **Call to Action Section** - Scheduling appointment
- **Share Options Bar** - Email, message, share buttons
- **Office Information Footer** - Practice details
- **Legal Disclaimer** - Medical & privacy notices

### 3. **Data Dependencies Mapped**
- `useBrandingContext()` - Colors, practice info, styling
- `dummyContactInfo` - Patient/parent details
- `dummyAffectedRegions` - Spinal region flags
- `dummySymptomsByRegion` - Symptoms mapped by region
- `dummyBrainScore` - Brain-O-Meter score
- `dummyRecommendations` - Care recommendations
- `dummyOfficeInfo` - Practice information

### 4. **Existing Components** (Already Modular)
âœ… SpineDiagram, BrainOMeter, OrganConnections, Recommendations are already separated

### 5. **Issues Identified**
- **Monolithic Structure**: 297-line component mixing presentation & logic
- **Inline Styling**: Dynamic colors scattered throughout JSX
- **Repeated Patterns**: Multiple sections with similar header styling
- **Hard Dependencies**: Direct dummy data imports instead of props
- **Mixed Concerns**: Branding logic embedded in presentation layer

### 6. **Proposed Modular Breakdown** (Atomic Design)

**ATOMS:**
- ReportHeader component
- SectionTitle component  
- ContactDetail component
- ActionButton component
- ShareButton component

**MOLECULES:**
- PatientInfo card
- RegionDetails card
- CallToAction card
- ShareOptions bar
- OfficeInfo card
- Disclaimer card

**ORGANISMS:**
- ReportHeader organism (title + actions)
- SpinalAssessmentGrid organism (diagram + regions)
- ReportContent organism (main content sections)
- ReportFooter organism (share + office + disclaimer)

**TEMPLATES:**
- ReportLayout template (overall page structure)

**PAGES:**
- DemoReportPage (data fetching + business logic)

This analysis provides foundation for implementing atomic design principles in subtask 6.2.

## Feature-Based Architecture Implementation Complete

The core refactoring and component architecture has been successfully implemented, transitioning from the previous structure to a feature-based architecture. Key accomplishments include:

1. New directory structure established, organizing code into features (auth, assessment, reports, dashboard) and shared modules.
2. Atomic design components relocated to src/shared/components/, categorized into atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates.
3. Shared services, hooks, types, utils, and constants consolidated and moved to appropriate directories under src/shared/.
4. Report-specific components moved to src/features/reports/components/.
5. New auth feature structure created with components, hooks, services, and types subdirectories.
6. Index files updated throughout the project to reflect new organization and maintain exports.
7. Backward compatibility layer added in src/components/index.ts to ease transition.

This restructuring provides a clear separation of concerns, improves code organization, and sets a scalable foundation for future feature development. Next steps include fixing import paths, testing compilation, updating any remaining old path references, and verifying correct feature exports.

## 2. Implement Atomic Design Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Decompose the template into atomic design components (atoms, molecules, organisms) and organize them within a scalable directory structure under /src/shared/components.
### Details:
Create React components following atomic design principles. Ensure components are reusable, composable, and organized for scalability. Use best practices for directory layout and naming conventions. Components have been successfully organized into atoms, molecules, and organisms within the /src/shared/components directory.

## 3. Define TypeScript Interfaces and Prop Types [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Establish clear TypeScript interfaces and prop types for each component to ensure type safety and reusability.
### Details:
For each component, define explicit TypeScript interfaces for props and state. Ensure all data passed between components is strongly typed and documented. TypeScript interfaces and prop types have been successfully implemented for all components.

## 4. Implement Responsive and Accessible Design [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Apply responsive design principles using CSS-in-JS or utility-first CSS frameworks, ensuring accessibility and mobile-first layouts.
### Details:
Style components to be responsive across devices and screen sizes. Incorporate accessibility best practices, such as semantic HTML and ARIA attributes. Responsive and accessible design has been successfully implemented across all components.

## 5. Document Components and Usage [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for each component, including usage examples, prop documentation, and integration guidelines.
### Details:
Write clear documentation for each component, covering purpose, props, usage examples, and integration with dynamic report generation logic. Include inline comments and maintain code quality with ESLint and Prettier. Comprehensive documentation has been completed for all components.
