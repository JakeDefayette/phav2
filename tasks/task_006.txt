# Task ID: 6
# Title: Core Refactoring & Component Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the static demoreport.tsx template into a modular, reusable React component architecture, separating presentational and data logic, and establishing the foundation for dynamic report generation.
# Details:
Begin by analyzing the existing demoreport.tsx template to identify logical UI sections and data dependencies. Decompose the template into atomic design components (atoms, molecules, organisms) and organize them within a clear directory structure under /src/components, following best practices for scalable React architecture. Separate presentational components (focused on UI) from container components (handling data and logic), leveraging patterns such as container/presentational split, compound components, and render props where appropriate. Define clear TypeScript interfaces and prop types for each component to ensure reusability and type safety. Implement responsive design using CSS-in-JS or utility-first CSS frameworks, ensuring accessibility and mobile-first layouts. Document each component with usage examples and prop documentation. Integrate the new architecture with the dynamic report generation logic, ensuring components are parameterized to accept data from the survey and database. Coordinate with the report generation system to support dynamic rendering and branding. Maintain code quality with ESLint, Prettier, and thorough inline documentation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that demoreport.tsx is fully refactored into atomic, reusable components with no duplicated logic. 2. Ensure presentational and container components are clearly separated and follow established patterns. 3. Confirm all components are parameterized, type-safe, and documented with usage examples. 4. Test responsive behavior across devices and browsers. 5. Integrate with dynamic report generation to validate that components render correctly with real survey data. 6. Run unit and integration tests for all new components. 7. Review code for adherence to architectural and style guidelines.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Modularize Existing Template [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the current demoreport.tsx template to identify logical UI sections and data dependencies. Break down the template into modular components, establishing a clear separation between presentational and container components.
### Details:
Map out the structure of the existing template, noting repeated patterns and distinct UI blocks. Propose an initial modular breakdown that will inform atomic design implementation.

## 2. Implement Atomic Design Component Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Decompose the template into atomic design components (atoms, molecules, organisms) and organize them within a scalable directory structure under /src/components.
### Details:
Create React components following atomic design principles. Ensure components are reusable, composable, and organized for scalability. Use best practices for directory layout and naming conventions.

## 3. Define TypeScript Interfaces and Prop Types [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Establish clear TypeScript interfaces and prop types for each component to ensure type safety and reusability.
### Details:
For each component, define explicit TypeScript interfaces for props and state. Ensure all data passed between components is strongly typed and documented.

## 4. Implement Responsive and Accessible Design [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Apply responsive design principles using CSS-in-JS or utility-first CSS frameworks, ensuring accessibility and mobile-first layouts.
### Details:
Style components to be responsive across devices and screen sizes. Incorporate accessibility best practices, such as semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

## 5. Document Components and Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for each component, including usage examples, prop documentation, and integration guidelines.
### Details:
Write clear documentation for each component, covering purpose, props, usage examples, and integration with dynamic report generation logic. Include inline comments and maintain code quality with ESLint and Prettier.
