# Task ID: 6
# Title: Refactor demoreport.tsx into Dynamic, Data-Driven Report System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Convert the static demoreport.tsx template into a dynamic React component that generates customizable reports from real survey data, supporting both web and PDF rendering. Implement an automated survey-to-report workflow for immediate report generation upon survey completion.
# Details:
Refactor demoreport.tsx to separate presentational and data logic, transforming static content into reusable, parameterized components. Integrate the component with the survey data model, ensuring it can accept and render real user responses, charts, and practice branding dynamically. Implement data fetching and mapping logic to populate the report with live data. Create an automated workflow that generates reports immediately after survey completion. Implement Next.js Server Actions for form handling and automatic redirect to the report page. Develop a dynamic report view at /dashboard/reports/[reportId] with PDF export functionality. Use React-PDF with dynamic imports or jsPDF for client-side PDF generation. Ensure the component is modular for future template expansion and supports responsive design. Implement user experience enhancements including completion confirmation, 'View Report' and 'Download PDF' buttons, and report sharing capabilities. Document the component API and provide usage examples for both web and PDF contexts.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the refactored report component for correct rendering with various data inputs. 2. Verify that all dynamic fields populate accurately from real survey data. 3. Test PDF export for layout consistency and data integrity. 4. Perform regression testing to ensure no loss of existing report features. 5. Manually review web and PDF outputs for branding, responsiveness, and accessibility. 6. Validate integration with the dynamic report generation system and survey data pipeline. 7. Test the complete survey-to-report automation workflow, including server actions and redirects. 8. Verify the functionality of 'View Report' and 'Download PDF' buttons. 9. Test report sharing capabilities. 10. Ensure proper handling of edge cases such as incomplete surveys or data errors.
