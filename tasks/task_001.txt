# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Modular Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Next.js (App Router), modular folder structure, and component library foundation.
# Details:
Use Next.js v14+ with App Router for optimal code splitting. Set up /src/components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates), /hooks, /services, /utils, /types, /constants. Initialize TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality. Use Vercel for hosting. Implement Atomic Design principles for component structure.

# Test Strategy:
Verify folder structure, linting, and TypeScript setup. Test basic Next.js routing and component rendering.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize the Next.js Project Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Next.js project repository using the latest version and initialize version control.
### Details:
Use the create-next-app CLI to scaffold the project, initialize a Git repository, and make the initial commit.
<info added on 2025-05-26T17:27:42.881Z>
**Initial Assessment:**
- Git repository is already initialized (✅)
- No package.json found - need to create Next.js project
- Current directory: /Users/jakedefayette/Desktop/Organized/PersonalProjects/pha-v2
- Existing files: .git/, .cursor/, .env, .gitignore, .taskmasterconfig, .venv/, README.md, scripts/, tasks/

**Plan:**
1. Create Next.js project using create-next-app:
   ```
   npx create-next-app@latest .
   ```
   - Choose "Yes" for TypeScript
   - Choose "Yes" for using App Router
   - Select other options as needed (e.g., ESLint, Tailwind CSS)

2. After project creation, review and adjust the generated files:
   - Ensure `app/` directory is present (indicating App Router usage)
   - Check `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
   - Verify `package.json` for correct dependencies and scripts

3. Make initial commit with the new Next.js setup:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Next.js setup with App Router and TypeScript"
   ```

4. Test the setup by running the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Verify that the app starts without errors and the default Next.js page loads in the browser.

Task 1.1 has been completed successfully. The Next.js project with App Router has been set up, including TypeScript configuration, Tailwind CSS integration, ESLint setup, and basic component structure. The project structure has been created with appropriate directories and configuration files. The development server is functioning correctly, and the initial Git commit has been made. The setup has been verified, with the app loading properly at http://localhost:3000 and displaying the welcome message. All planned steps have been executed, and the project is now ready for further configuration and development in the subsequent tasks.

## 2. Configure Next.js with App Router [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up Next.js to use the App Router for routing and ensure the app directory is present.
### Details:
During project setup, select 'Yes' for App Router to generate the /app directory and enable the latest routing conventions.
<info added on 2025-05-26T17:39:00.058Z>
The Next.js App Router is properly configured and working:

Confirmed Setup:
- `src/app/` directory structure is in place
- `layout.tsx` with proper RootLayout component and metadata
- `page.tsx` with functional home page component
- `next.config.js` configured (App Router is enabled by default in Next.js 14+)
- App Router routing conventions are being used

Key Features Verified:
- Root layout with proper HTML structure and Inter font
- Metadata configuration for SEO
- Server components by default (no 'use client' needed for static content)
- Proper TypeScript integration with layout and page components
- Tailwind CSS integration working correctly

The App Router setup is complete and ready for the next configuration steps.

## 3. Set Up TypeScript Support [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure TypeScript in the Next.js project for type safety and scalability.
### Details:
Install TypeScript and required type definitions, then allow Next.js to generate tsconfig.json and convert starter files to .tsx/.ts as needed.
<info added on 2025-05-26T17:39:35.268Z>
TypeScript support has been fully configured:

- tsconfig.json created with optimal Next.js configuration
- TypeScript 5.7.3 installed in devDependencies
- Required type definitions installed: @types/node (22.10.5), @types/react (19.0.2), @types/react-dom (19.0.2)
- next-env.d.ts generated by Next.js for type definitions
- Path mapping configured (@/* → ./src/*)

Key features implemented:
- Strict mode enabled for better type safety
- App Router TypeScript support with Next.js plugin
- Incremental compilation for faster builds
- JSX preserve mode for Next.js optimization
- Module resolution set to "bundler" for modern bundling

Verification completed:
- Type checking passes with no errors (npx tsc --noEmit)
- All existing components (layout.tsx, page.tsx) are properly typed

The project is now ready for development with full TypeScript support.

## 4. Establish Modular Folder Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create a modular folder structure including components, hooks, services, utils, types, and constants directories.
### Details:
Organize the src directory (or root) with clearly separated folders for each module to promote maintainability and scalability.

## 5. Implement Atomic Design Principles in Component Library [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Structure the components directory according to Atomic Design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages).
### Details:
Within the components folder, create subfolders for each Atomic Design level and provide example components for each.
<info added on 2025-05-26T17:51:23.401Z>
The Atomic Design structure has been successfully implemented with a comprehensive component library. The directory structure includes folders for atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. Specific components created include:

Atoms: Button (with variants and sizes), Input (with validation states), and Label (with variants).
Molecules: FormField and Card.
Organisms: Header and Form.
Templates: PageLayout.

Supporting infrastructure includes a utility function for Tailwind class merging, proper barrel exports, and main export updates. Documentation has been added, including a detailed README, usage examples, and best practices. All components use TypeScript with proper interfaces, Tailwind CSS for styling, and follow accessibility and responsive design patterns.

The implementation is integrated with the existing project structure, uses path aliases, and is ready for use in the Next.js app router. This provides a solid foundation for building consistent, reusable UI components following Atomic Design principles.

## 6. Set Up ESLint and Prettier for Code Quality [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Install and configure ESLint and Prettier for linting and code formatting.
### Details:
Add ESLint and Prettier dependencies, create configuration files, and ensure they work with TypeScript and Next.js.

## 7. Configure Husky for Git Hooks [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Husky to enforce code quality checks (linting, formatting) before commits and pushes.
### Details:
Install Husky, add pre-commit and pre-push hooks to run ESLint and Prettier, and verify integration with the repository.
<info added on 2025-05-26T17:59:31.310Z>
Husky v9.1.7 installed as dev dependency. Configured 'prepare' script in package.json for automatic setup. Created pre-commit hook running 'npm run code-quality' (ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript) and pre-push hook running 'npm run build' for build verification. Updated hooks to use newer Husky format and made them executable. Created/modified files: .husky/pre-commit, .husky/pre-push, package.json, and docs/git-hooks.md. Verified code quality script passes, build process successful, and pre-commit hook working. All formatting issues resolved. Benefits include automated code quality enforcement, prevention of broken code commits, build verification before pushes, consistent development standards, and early error detection.
