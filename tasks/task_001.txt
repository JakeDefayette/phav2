# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Modular Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Next.js (App Router), modular folder structure, and component library foundation.
# Details:
Use Next.js v14+ with App Router for optimal code splitting. Set up /src/components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates), /hooks, /services, /utils, /types, /constants. Initialize TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality. Use Vercel for hosting. Implement Atomic Design principles for component structure.

# Test Strategy:
Verify folder structure, linting, and TypeScript setup. Test basic Next.js routing and component rendering.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize the Next.js Project Repository [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Next.js project repository using the latest version and initialize version control.
### Details:
Use the create-next-app CLI to scaffold the project, initialize a Git repository, and make the initial commit.

**Initial Assessment:**
- Git repository is already initialized (âœ…)
- No package.json found - need to create Next.js project
- Current directory: /Users/jakedefayette/Desktop/Organized/PersonalProjects/pha-v2
- Existing files: .git/, .cursor/, .env, .gitignore, .taskmasterconfig, .venv/, README.md, scripts/, tasks/

**Plan:**
1. Create Next.js project using create-next-app:
   ```
   npx create-next-app@latest .
   ```
   - Choose "Yes" for TypeScript
   - Choose "Yes" for using App Router
   - Select other options as needed (e.g., ESLint, Tailwind CSS)

2. After project creation, review and adjust the generated files:
   - Ensure `app/` directory is present (indicating App Router usage)
   - Check `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
   - Verify `package.json` for correct dependencies and scripts

3. Make initial commit with the new Next.js setup:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Next.js setup with App Router and TypeScript"
   ```

4. Test the setup by running the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Verify that the app starts without errors and the default Next.js page loads in the browser.

## 2. Configure Next.js with App Router [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up Next.js to use the App Router for routing and ensure the app directory is present.
### Details:
During project setup, select 'Yes' for App Router to generate the /app directory and enable the latest routing conventions.

## 3. Set Up TypeScript Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure TypeScript in the Next.js project for type safety and scalability.
### Details:
Install TypeScript and required type definitions, then allow Next.js to generate tsconfig.json and convert starter files to .tsx/.ts as needed.

## 4. Establish Modular Folder Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create a modular folder structure including components, hooks, services, utils, types, and constants directories.
### Details:
Organize the src directory (or root) with clearly separated folders for each module to promote maintainability and scalability.

## 5. Implement Atomic Design Principles in Component Library [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Structure the components directory according to Atomic Design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages).
### Details:
Within the components folder, create subfolders for each Atomic Design level and provide example components for each.

## 6. Set Up ESLint and Prettier for Code Quality [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Install and configure ESLint and Prettier for linting and code formatting.
### Details:
Add ESLint and Prettier dependencies, create configuration files, and ensure they work with TypeScript and Next.js.

## 7. Configure Husky for Git Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Husky to enforce code quality checks (linting, formatting) before commits and pushes.
### Details:
Install Husky, add pre-commit and pre-push hooks to run ESLint and Prettier, and verify integration with the repository.

## 8. Configure Vercel Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7
### Description: Set up deployment to Vercel for continuous integration and delivery.
### Details:
Connect the repository to Vercel, configure project settings, and verify successful deployment of the modular Next.js app.
