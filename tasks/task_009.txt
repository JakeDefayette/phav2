2. Design and implement a persistent sidebar navigation component with main dashboard sections.
3. Enhance the existing top navigation bar to integrate with the new sidebar.
4. Implement a responsive grid system within the DashboardLayout to ensure proper content organization on various screen sizes.
5. Develop dashboard-specific atomic and molecular components for consistent UI across dashboard features.
6. Refactor the current /src/app/dashboard/page.tsx to use the new DashboardLayout and components.
7. Implement navigation state management to handle active states and user interactions.
8. Ensure the new layout maintains compatibility with existing RoleGuard components for permission-based rendering.
9. Optimize the responsive design for enhanced mobile user experience.
10. Update the dashboard sections (overview, contacts, videos, templates, assessments, settings) to fit within the new layout structure.

   - Card variations, modals, toast notifications, data tables
   - Navigation components, header/footer layouts

3. Create src/features/dashboard/components/ for dashboard-specific UI elements.

4. Ensure consistent styling and behavior across all shared components.

5. Implement a clear separation between feature-specific and shared components.

6. Remove the atomic design approach (atoms/molecules/organisms) in favor of feature-based organization.

7. Establish documentation and usage guidelines for both shared and feature-specific components.

8. Set up a testing strategy for all components, including unit tests and visual testing.

    - Implement dashboard-specific services, hooks, and types as needed

14. Set up shared utilities:
    - Create src/shared/services/ for core services like auth and API communication
    - Implement src/shared/hooks/ for generic hooks

Implementation Plan for Feature-Based Component Architecture:

Phase 1: Reorganize Shared Components (Current Step)
1. Audit existing components in src/shared/components/ for true reusability across features.
2. Reorganize shared components into logical groupings, moving away from strict atomic design:
   - UI Elements: buttons, inputs, typography, icons
   - Layout: grids, containers, responsive helpers
   - Data Display: tables, cards, lists
   - Feedback: modals, toasts, alerts
   - Navigation: menus, tabs, breadcrumbs
3. Update component exports to reflect new organization.
4. Ensure consistent naming conventions and prop interfaces across shared components.

Phase 2: Enhance Dashboard Feature Components
1. Review and expand src/features/dashboard/components/ for dashboard-specific UI elements.
2. Create or update dashboard-specific services in src/features/dashboard/services/.
3. Implement custom hooks for dashboard functionality in src/features/dashboard/hooks/.
4. Define dashboard-specific types and interfaces in src/features/dashboard/types/.
5. Ensure clear separation between shared and feature-specific components, avoiding duplication.

Phase 3: Component Documentation & Testing
1. Create a documentation structure for both shared and feature-specific components.
2. Write usage guidelines and examples for each component.
3. Implement a testing strategy:
   - Unit tests for component logic
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Visual regression tests using Storybook or similar tool
4. Ensure all components meet WCAG accessibility standards.

Next Steps:
1. Begin auditing shared components for reusability and reorganization.
2. Enhance shared component exports to align with new organization.
3. Identify and create any missing dashboard-specific components.
4. Implement a theming system for consistent styling across components.
5. Set up initial documentation structure and start documenting key components.
