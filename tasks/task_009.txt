# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Chiropractor Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the chiropractor dashboard for practice management and customization within the new feature-based architecture.
# Details:
Create dashboard layout with reusable components in src/features/dashboard/components/. Implement practice branding, contact management, and video upload. Use Next.js App Router for routing in src/app/dashboard/. Support customization of email templates and assessment questions. Place shared components in src/shared/components/ following atomic design principles.

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard navigation, customization features, and data display in src/features/dashboard/__tests__/.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Dashboard Layout and Navigation Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the overall layout and navigation structure for the chiropractor dashboard, ensuring user-centric design and mobile responsiveness.
### Details:
Define the main dashboard sections (overview, contacts, videos, templates, assessments, settings). Establish a responsive grid and sidebar/topbar navigation using Next.js App Router.

Based on the initial analysis, update the dashboard implementation plan:

1. Create a DashboardLayout component in /src/features/dashboard/components/ to serve as a shell for all dashboard pages.
2. Design and implement a persistent sidebar navigation component with main dashboard sections.
3. Enhance the existing top navigation bar to integrate with the new sidebar.
4. Implement a responsive grid system within the DashboardLayout to ensure proper content organization on various screen sizes.
5. Develop dashboard-specific atomic and molecular components for consistent UI across dashboard features.
6. Refactor the current /src/app/dashboard/page.tsx to use the new DashboardLayout and components.
7. Implement navigation state management to handle active states and user interactions.
8. Ensure the new layout maintains compatibility with existing RoleGuard components for permission-based rendering.
9. Optimize the responsive design for enhanced mobile user experience.
10. Update the dashboard sections (overview, contacts, videos, templates, assessments, settings) to fit within the new layout structure.

Implementation Progress Update:

The dashboard layout structure has been successfully created with the following key components and features:

1. DashboardLayout Component (/src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardLayout/DashboardLayout.tsx):
   - Full-height responsive layout with sidebar and main content area
   - Persistent sidebar with navigation items for all dashboard sections
   - Mobile-responsive design with hamburger menu and overlay
   - Role-based navigation items using RoleGuard components
   - User info display in sidebar footer
   - Clean top navigation with search placeholder and logout button
   - Proper z-index management for mobile overlay

2. DashboardContent Component (/src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardContent/DashboardContent.tsx):
   - Enhanced welcome section with user greeting and role display
   - Redesigned feature cards with improved visual hierarchy
   - Icon-based cards with hover effects
   - Role-based feature visibility
   - Development-only permissions debug panel
   - Responsive grid layout

3. Updated Dashboard Page (/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx):
   - Simplified to use new layout components
   - Maintains authentication guards
   - Clean separation of concerns

Navigation structure implemented includes: Overview, Practice Management, Contacts, Videos, Templates, Assessments, My Children, Reports, and Settings, with role-based access control.

Key features of the implementation:
- Fully responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Role-based access control integration
- Modern UI using Tailwind CSS
- Hover effects and transitions
- Accessible navigation structure
- Clean component architecture following atomic design

Next steps include testing the layout in browser, refining mobile responsiveness, adding active state detection for navigation, and considering search functionality implementation.

## 2. Develop Reusable Atomic Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build atomic, reusable UI components (atoms, molecules, organisms) to be used throughout the dashboard, following atomic design principles.
### Details:
Implement basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, modals) and compose them into larger, reusable structures for dashboard features.
<info added on 2025-06-01T02:28:45.131Z>
Implement a feature-based architecture with shared components following atomic design principles:

1. Create src/shared/components/ directory with subdirectories for atoms, molecules, and organisms.

2. Develop atomic components:
   - Atoms: Enhanced buttons, form inputs, typography components, loading spinners, and badges
   - Molecules: Form fields, card variations, modals, toast notifications, and data tables
   - Organisms: Navigation components, header/footer layouts, complex forms, and data visualization containers

3. Ensure all shared components are reusable across features and follow consistent styling and behavior.

4. Implement feature-specific components in src/features/dashboard/components/ for dashboard-exclusive UI elements.

5. Establish clear documentation and usage guidelines for the component library to facilitate adoption across all feature modules.

6. Set up a testing strategy for shared components, including unit tests and storybook integration for visual testing.

7. Create a theming system that allows for easy customization of shared components across different features.

8. Implement accessibility standards (WCAG) in all shared components to ensure inclusivity.

9. Optimize shared components for performance, considering lazy loading and code splitting where appropriate.

10. Set up a versioning system for the shared component library to manage updates and backwards compatibility.
