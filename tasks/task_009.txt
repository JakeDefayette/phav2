<info added on 2025-06-01T22:10:01.209Z>
Based on the analysis of the current dashboard routing structure, we need to:

1. Create the following missing route pages:
   - /dashboard/templates
   - /dashboard/assessments
   - /dashboard/reports
   - /dashboard/settings

2. Implement route guards for these new pages, ensuring they follow the existing security patterns (role-based access control, session management).

3. Update the navigation component to include working links for all routes, including the newly created ones.

4. Review and refactor shared components:
   - Ensure new pages utilize existing atomic design structure (atoms/molecules/organisms)
   - Update index files to export any new shared components
   - Verify that AuthProvider, ToastProvider, and ErrorBoundary are properly applied to new routes

5. Conduct thorough testing of all routes, including:
   - Accessibility of each page based on user roles
   - Proper rendering of components
   - Correct application of middleware (security headers, route protection)

6. Document any new shared components created for the new routes and update the component library documentation if necessary.
