# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Core Survey Form Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build reusable, modular survey form components for the 3-step assessment process.
# Details:
Create React components for each survey step (Lifestyle Stressors, Symptoms, Contact/Consent). Use Formik v2+ and Yup for validation. Ensure mobile-first, accessible design. Implement progress indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation, navigation between steps, and accessibility. Verify mobile responsiveness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Form Architecture Setup with Formik and Yup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational form architecture using Formik for state management and Yup for schema-based validation. Ensure the setup supports multi-step navigation, validation per step, and integrates with the project's atomic design and 3-layer architecture.
### Details:
Implement a parent form component that manages step state, initializes Formik with initial values, and applies Yup validation schemas. Structure the form to allow step-specific validation and easy integration of step components. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness are considered from the start.

## Implementation Plan for Form Architecture

### Current State Analysis:
- Formik v2.4.6 and Yup v1.6.1 already installed
- Existing atomic components: Input, Button, Label
- Existing FormField molecule that combines Input + Label
- Atomic design structure in place

### Form Requirements Summary:
Step 1: 8 lifestyle stressor checkboxes
Step 2: 9 symptom checkboxes  
Step 3: Contact form with text inputs, radio buttons, and consent checkboxes

### Implementation Approach:
1. Create Checkbox atom component (missing from current atoms)
2. Create RadioButton atom component 
3. Create CheckboxGroup and RadioGroup molecules
4. Create MultiStepForm organism with Formik integration
5. Define Yup validation schemas for each step
6. Implement step navigation logic with validation

### File Structure Plan:
src/components/
├── atoms/
│   ├── Checkbox/
│   └── RadioButton/
├── molecules/
│   ├── CheckboxGroup/
│   ├── RadioGroup/
│   └── StepIndicator/
└── organisms/
    └── MultiStepSurveyForm/

Begin implementation following this plan, ensuring each component is created according to the atomic design principles and integrates seamlessly with Formik and Yup for form management and validation.

## Implementation Completed

The core survey form components have been successfully developed and implemented. Key accomplishments include:

1. Created atomic components: Checkbox and RadioButton
2. Built molecular components: CheckboxGroup, RadioGroup, and StepIndicator
3. Developed MultiStepSurveyForm organism with Formik and Yup integration
4. Implemented all required form features:
   - Step 1: Lifestyle Stressors (8 checkboxes)
   - Step 2: Symptoms (9 checkboxes)
   - Step 3: Contact form with required fields, gender selection, and consent checkboxes
5. Added step-by-step validation, responsive design, and accessibility features
6. Ensured code quality with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier
7. Followed atomic design principles and maintained consistency with existing patterns

New files have been created in the appropriate directories under src/components/. The form architecture is now complete and ready for integration into the main application.

## 2. Develop Step 1: Lifestyle Stressors Component [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create the first step of the survey form focused on collecting lifestyle stressors data. This component should be modular, reusable, and follow atomic design principles.
### Details:
Design and implement the UI for lifestyle stressors questions, connect fields to Formik state, and apply relevant Yup validation. Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness. Integrate with the parent form's step logic.

Implementation Status: COMPLETED

The Step 1: Lifestyle Stressors Component has been successfully implemented as part of the MultiStepSurveyForm organism. Key accomplishments include:

1. UI Implementation: 8 lifestyle stressor options with accessible checkbox interface and 2-column responsive layout.
2. Formik Integration: Connected to Formik state management using 'lifestyleStressors' field.
3. Yup Validation: Requires at least one selection with clear error messaging.
4. Atomic Design Compliance: Uses Checkbox atom and CheckboxGroup molecule components.
5. Accessibility & Responsiveness: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and mobile-first design.
6. Data Structure: All 8 required lifestyle stressors implemented.

Technical details:
- Component Location: src/components/organisms/MultiStepSurveyForm/MultiStepSurveyForm.tsx
- Data Source: src/components/organisms/MultiStepSurveyForm/formData.ts
- Validation: src/components/organisms/MultiStepSurveyForm/validation.ts
- Full TypeScript support

The component is fully integrated into the multi-step form architecture, handling step navigation, progress indication, form state persistence, validation feedback, and error handling.

## 3. Develop Step 2: Symptoms Component [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Build the second step of the survey form to capture symptoms information. Maintain separation of concerns and adhere to the 3-layer architecture.
### Details:
Implement symptom-related fields, connect them to Formik, and apply step-specific Yup validation. Ensure the component is accessible, responsive, and fits within the atomic design system.

## 4. Develop Step 3: Contact/Consent Component [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement the final step of the survey form for collecting user contact information and consent. Ensure compliance with privacy and accessibility standards.
### Details:
Create fields for contact details and consent checkboxes, wire them to Formik, and enforce validation with Yup. Ensure the UI is accessible, mobile-friendly, and consistent with the design system.
<info added on 2025-05-27T16:14:26.599Z>
Step 3: Contact/Consent Component is fully implemented in the MultiStepSurveyForm organism. All required fields from form_req.md are present, including parent/guardian information, child information, contact details, and consent checkboxes. The implementation includes proper Formik integration, comprehensive Yup validation, error handling, accessibility features, and responsive design. The component is located in src/components/organisms/MultiStepSurveyForm/MultiStepSurveyForm.tsx (lines 130-250), with supporting files for types, validation, and form data. All validation rules are in place, and testing has verified the integration with existing architecture and consistency with other steps. No further development is needed for this component.
