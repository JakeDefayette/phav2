# Task ID: 14
# Title: Optimize for Performance and Bundle Size
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize application for fast load times and minimal bundle size within the new feature-based architecture.
# Details:
Implement code splitting, tree-shaking, and dynamic imports across all feature modules. Enforce file size limits (React components <200 lines, utility functions <100 lines, etc.). Use Lighthouse CI and bundle analyzer. Target initial load <50KB, route chunks <25KB, total app <200KB gzipped. Optimize imports to leverage the new directory structure.

# Test Strategy:
Run Lighthouse audits, bundle analysis, and performance tests in src/shared/__tests__/performance/.
