# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Authentication with Supabase Auth
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate secure user authentication for chiropractors and parents using Supabase Auth.
# Details:
Use Supabase Auth (v2+) for authentication. Set up email/password and OAuth providers. Implement session management, secure cookies, and session timeout. Ensure input validation and sanitization. Store user roles (chiropractor, parent).

   - Includes fallback content for unauthorized access

4. Enhanced Middleware (middleware.ts):
   - Added role-based route protection to existing auth middleware
   - Implemented user profile fetching and role verification
   - Defined role-specific routes for chiropractors and parents

5. Role-Based Dashboard Pages:
   - Updated main dashboard with role-specific content sections
   - Created practice management page for chiropractors
   - Created children management page for parents
   - Added permission debugging information for development

6. Integration with Existing System:
   - Leveraged existing database schema (user_profiles table with role field)
   - Integrated with existing Supabase auth system and registration flow

Testing initiated with development server to verify implementation, including role-based routing, redirections, and fallback content for unauthorized access.

## 5. Develop protected routes and authorization [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create route protection based on authentication status and user roles
### Details:
Implement middleware to verify authentication status before accessing protected routes, create role-based access control for different sections of the application, handle unauthorized access attempts, develop redirect logic for unauthenticated users
<info added on 2025-05-26T20:45:39.202Z>
Initial analysis of the authentication system has been completed. The current implementation includes comprehensive middleware for route protection, role-based access control, session management with refresh logic, a RoleGuard component for client-side protection, role utilities with a permissions system, and protected dashboard routes.

Key components already in place:
1. Server-side protection in middleware.ts
2. Client-side protection with RoleGuard component and useAuth hook
3. Basic route structure for dashboard, children, and practice areas

Missing components identified for complete implementation:
1. Unauthorized access page/component
2. Error boundary for auth errors
3. Loading states for route transitions
4. More granular route protection (e.g., assessment routes)
5. Improved redirect handling

Next steps:
1. Develop an unauthorized access page
2. Implement an error boundary for auth failures
3. Enhance route protection to include assessment routes
4. Conduct comprehensive testing of all protection scenarios
5. Add loading states to improve user experience during route transitions
