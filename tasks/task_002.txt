# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Authentication with Supabase Auth
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate secure user authentication for chiropractors and parents using Supabase Auth.
# Details:
Use Supabase Auth (v2+) for authentication. Set up email/password and OAuth providers. Implement session management, secure cookies, and session timeout. Ensure input validation and sanitization. Store user roles (chiropractor, parent).

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, logout, and session management. Verify role-based access and session timeout.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Supabase Auth configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Supabase Auth settings including email/password authentication and OAuth providers
### Details:
Create a Supabase project, configure authentication settings in the Supabase dashboard, enable email/password authentication, set up OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, etc.), and configure redirect URLs for authentication flow

âœ… Supabase Auth Configuration Setup Complete

Implementation Details:
- Installed @supabase/supabase-js package
- Created modular Supabase client configurations:
  - src/lib/supabase.ts - Client-side Supabase client with auth settings
  - src/lib/supabase-server.ts - Server-side client for API routes
- Defined TypeScript types in src/types/auth.ts:
  - UserRole type (chiropractor | parent)
  - UserProfile interface with role-based fields
  - AuthState, LoginCredentials, RegisterCredentials interfaces
- Created comprehensive setup documentation in docs/supabase-setup.md
- Implemented auth callback route at src/app/auth/callback/route.ts

Configuration Features:
- Auto-refresh tokens enabled
- Session persistence configured
- URL detection for OAuth flows
- Proper error handling for auth callbacks
- Environment variable validation
- Modular architecture following project standards

Next Steps:
- User needs to create Supabase project and configure environment variables
- Ready to proceed with registration/login flow implementation
