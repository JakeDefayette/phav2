<info added on 2025-06-02T17:40:42.999Z>
**Initial Exploration & Planning (Iteration 1):**

Starting implementation of automated bounce and complaint handling system for comprehensive email deliverability management:

**Current State Analysis:**
- ✅ **Foundation Systems Complete**: Email tracking system (10.4) provides webhook infrastructure for receiving bounce/complaint events
- ✅ **Compliance Framework**: GDPR compliance system (10.5) includes suppression list management foundation  
- ✅ **Database Infrastructure**: `email_tracking_events` table exists with `bounce_type_enum` for hard/soft bounces
- ✅ **Webhook Handler**: `/api/webhooks/resend` endpoint already handles bounce and complaint events from Resend
- ✅ **Tracking Service**: EmailTrackingService has suppression list management methods but needs enhancement

**Implementation Plan for Subtask 10.6:**

**Phase 1: Enhanced Bounce Processing**
- Analyze current webhook handling for bounce events in tracking service
- Implement sophisticated bounce classification (hard vs soft bounces)
- Create bounce retry logic with exponential backoff for soft bounces
- Build automatic suppression list updates for hard bounces
- Add bounce reason tracking and categorization

**Phase 2: Complaint Handling Workflows**
- Enhance complaint processing in webhook handler
- Implement automatic unsubscribe for spam complaints
- Create complaint notification system for practice administrators
- Build complaint reason tracking and analysis
- Add sender reputation monitoring

**Phase 3: Automated List Cleaning**
- Create scheduled job for automatic suppression list maintenance
- Implement bounce rate monitoring per practice
- Build automatic sender reputation health checks
- Create list hygiene recommendations and alerts
- Add bounce pattern analysis and reporting

**Phase 4: Deliverability Monitoring & Notifications**
- Build real-time deliverability dashboard
- Create alert system for high bounce rates
- Implement notification workflows for deliverability issues
- Add reputation score tracking and trends
- Create automated remediation suggestions

**Files to Analyze/Modify:**
- `src/shared/services/email/tracking.ts` - Enhance existing suppression list management
- `src/app/api/webhooks/resend/route.ts` - Review current bounce/complaint handling
- Database schema - Check if additional tables needed for bounce analysis
- Create new services: bounce processor, complaint handler, deliverability monitor
- Build dashboard components for bounce/complaint management

**Next Steps:**
1. Analyze existing webhook and tracking infrastructure
2. Enhance bounce classification and processing logic
3. Build automated complaint handling workflows
4. Implement deliverability monitoring dashboard
5. Create notification systems for administrators
