# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate Email Service (Resend)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Resend for automated email delivery and campaign management within the new feature-based architecture with shared services for cross-feature usage.
# Details:
Use Resend API (latest) for sending emails with multi-tenant isolation and GDPR compliance. Implement core email functionality in src/shared/services/email/ for cross-feature usage. Feature-specific components in src/features/dashboard/services/emailScheduler.ts and campaignManager.ts. Email template components in src/features/dashboard/components/EmailTemplateEditor/ and EmailAnalytics/. Include rate limiting, webhook security, and cross-client compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Test email delivery, scheduling, template rendering, webhook security, and email client compatibility in src/features/dashboard/__tests__/email.test.ts and src/shared/services/email/__tests__/. Include visual regression tests for email templates and integration tests for the full email pipeline.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Resend API integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the Resend API in your application by obtaining an API key and setting up the necessary environment variables.
### Details:
Create a Resend account, verify your domain on the Domains page, generate an API key from the API Keys page, and store it securely in your environment variables as RESEND_API_KEY. Install the Resend SDK for your programming language.

## 2. Implement email template system [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create reusable email templates using React Email components for consistent messaging across your application.
### Details:
Set up React Email components to define the structure and styling of your emails. Create base templates for different types of emails (welcome, notification, etc.). Implement a component-based approach that allows for dynamic content insertion while maintaining consistent branding.

## 3. Develop API endpoint for email sending [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create a server-side API endpoint that handles email sending requests and validates input data.
### Details:
Implement a POST endpoint using your framework's routing system. Use Zod or similar validation library to validate incoming request data. Create an instance of the Resend SDK with your API key. Structure the endpoint to accept recipient details, email subject, and content parameters.

## 4. Build email scheduling mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement a system to schedule emails for future delivery with configurable timing options.
### Details:
Create a database schema to store scheduled emails with recipient, content, and delivery time. Implement a background job processor (like Bull or node-cron) to check for and send scheduled emails. Add API endpoints to create, view, update, and delete scheduled emails.

## 5. Implement email tracking functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Add capabilities to track email opens, clicks, and delivery status for analytics and monitoring.
### Details:
Configure Resend's tracking features through their API. Create a database schema to store tracking events. Implement webhook endpoints to receive tracking data from Resend. Build a dashboard or reporting system to visualize email performance metrics.

## 6. Develop comprehensive error handling [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Implement robust error handling for email sending failures, with retry mechanisms and error logging.
### Details:
Create error handling middleware to catch and process email sending failures. Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors. Set up detailed logging for debugging purposes. Create a notification system to alert administrators of persistent email delivery issues.

## 7. Create testing framework for email functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6
### Description: Develop unit and integration tests to ensure reliable email delivery and template rendering.
### Details:
Write unit tests for email template rendering. Create integration tests for the email sending API. Implement end-to-end tests for the complete email flow. Set up a test environment with a sandbox SMTP server to avoid sending real emails during testing. Create test fixtures for different email scenarios.

## 8. Prepare documentation and deployment strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the email system and develop a deployment plan for production.
### Details:
Document the API endpoints, template system, and configuration options. Create usage examples for common email scenarios. Develop a deployment checklist including environment variable setup, domain verification, and security considerations. Plan for monitoring and scaling the email system in production.

## 9. Document API endpoints for shared services [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive API documentation for all shared services, including request/response schemas, authentication, and rate limits.
### Details:


## 10. Document email template usage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document how to use email templates, including dynamic data examples and customization options.
### Details:


## 11. Document configuration options [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document all relevant configuration options for the email service and related deployment settings.
### Details:


## 12. Develop troubleshooting guides and error handling procedures [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document common error scenarios, their causes, and troubleshooting steps for the email service.
### Details:


## 13. Create deployment checklist [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a detailed deployment checklist, including steps for environment variable configuration, build processes, and pre-deployment checks.
### Details:


## 14. Create architecture diagrams [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop architecture diagrams illustrating the email service components, data flow, and integrations with other services.
### Details:
