          "details": "The \"generate Report\" functionality is not working when users complete the survey. This issue prevents users from receiving their pediatric health assessment reports, breaking the core value proposition of the platform. Need to investigate the report generation pipeline, identify the failure points, and implement a robust fix.\n\nKey areas to investigate:\n1. Survey submission workflow in /api/assessment/[id]/submit\n2. Report generation service integration\n3. PDF generation pipeline\n4. Database transaction completion\n5. Error handling and user feedback\n6. Report retrieval and display functionality\n\nExpected outcome: Users can successfully complete surveys and receive their generated reports without errors.\n<info added on 2025-05-30T00:36:19.481Z>\nInitial Investigation Results:\n\nAnalysis of the report generation flow has identified the following key components and current workflow:\n\n1. Survey submission: Handled by form in `/src/app/survey/page.tsx`\n2. Assessment creation: Via `/api/assessment/start`\n3. Response submission: Through `/api/assessment/[id]/submit`\n4. Atomic operations: Managed by `DatabaseTransactionService.submitAssessmentAtomic()`\n5. Report generation: Utilizes `ReportsService.generateReportWithProgress()`\n6. Completion: Should redirect to `/reports/[reportId]`\n\nKey components analyzed:\n- Submit API Route: `/src/app/api/assessment/[id]/submit/route.ts`\n- Transaction Service: `DatabaseTransactionService.submitAssessmentAtomic()`\n- Reports Service: `generateReportWithProgress()`\n- Survey Form: Uses basic `MultiStepSurveyForm` (workflow features disabled)\n\nNext steps for debugging:\n1. Test the actual survey flow to pinpoint the exact failure point\n2. Examine browser console for submission errors\n3. Verify functionality of API endpoints\n4. Manually test report generation\n5. Monitor database records during the process\n\nThe existing infrastructure appears complete, suggesting the issue likely lies in execution or data flow rather than missing components.\n</info added on 2025-05-30T00:36:19.481Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-30T00:48:33.464Z>\nRoot cause identified for assessment creation failure:\n\n- AssessmentsService.startAssessment() uses client-side supabase client (anon key)\n- API routes require server-side supabaseServer client (service role key)\n- All services inherit from BaseService, which imports client-side supabase client\n\nCurrent problematic flow:\n1. API route calls assessmentsService.startAssessment(childId, practiceId)\n2. Service calls this.create(assessmentData) (inherited from BaseService)\n3. BaseService uses client-side supabase client\n4. Operation fails due to insufficient permissions\n\nImmediate solution:\nImplement a quick fix by creating the assessment directly in the API route using supabaseServer.\n\nFollow-up tasks:\n1. Refactor services to have server-side versions or inject client dependency\n2. Consider modifying BaseService to accept client as a constructor parameter\n3. Review and update other API routes and services for similar issues\n4. Implement proper error handling and logging for permission-related failures\n5. Update documentation to clarify the use of client-side vs. server-side Supabase clients\n\nAfter implementing the quick fix, thoroughly test the entire workflow to ensure the report generation process works end-to-end.\n</info added on 2025-05-30T00:48:33.464Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-30T00:54:39.749Z>\nAssessment creation issue resolved. Root causes identified and fixed:\n\n1. Service layer using incorrect Supabase client (client-side instead of server-side).\n2. Schema mismatches between database types and actual schema.\n\nSolutions implemented:\n1. Replaced assessmentsService.startAssessment() with direct supabaseServer operations.\n2. Corrected schema issues:\n   - Used created_at instead of non-existent started_at\n   - Used 'draft' status for assessment_status enum\n   - Added required parent_email field\n   - Implemented default practice ID when not provided\n3. Added proper validation for required fields\n\nTest results confirm successful assessment creation, proper response handling, anonymous user creation flow, and field validation.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Test complete survey submission flow\n2. Verify end-to-end report generation\n3. Consider architectural improvements for service layer\n4. Update database types to match actual schema\n</info added on 2025-05-30T00:54:39.749Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-30T00:55:34.458Z>\nSystemic architectural issue identified affecting the entire service layer:\n\n1. All services currently use client-side Supabase client, incompatible with API routes.\n2. Root cause: BaseService imports client-side 'supabase' client instead of server-side 'supabaseServer'.\n3. This affects AssessmentsService, SurveyResponsesService, ReportsService, and DatabaseTransactionService.\n\nImmediate action plan:\n1. Implement a quick fix for survey submission by bypassing services and using direct database operations in the submit route.\n2. Test the complete report generation flow after fixing survey submission.\n3. Plan a comprehensive architectural refactor for the service layer to support both client-side and server-side contexts.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Create server-side versions of critical services or implement dependency injection for Supabase client.\n2. Update all API routes to use the correct server-side operations.\n3. Refactor BaseService to accept the Supabase client as a constructor parameter.\n4. Implement proper error handling and logging for permission-related failures.\n5. Update documentation to clearly distinguish between client-side and server-side Supabase client usage.\n6. Conduct a thorough review of all services and API routes to ensure correct client usage.\n\nPriority: High - This issue is blocking core functionality and needs immediate attention.\n</info added on 2025-05-30T00:55:34.458Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-30T00:58:14.657Z>\nSurvey submission endpoint has been successfully fixed to use the server-side Supabase client. Key improvements include:\n\n1. Replaced DatabaseTransactionService with direct server-side implementation using supabaseServer.\n2. Implemented a step-by-step process for survey submission:\n   a. Validate assessment existence and status\n   b. Insert survey responses\n   c. Complete assessment with brain-o-meter score\n   d. Generate basic report record\n3. Added rollback logic for each step to maintain data integrity.\n4. Implemented comprehensive logging for debugging purposes.\n5. Maintained all existing validation and error handling from the original implementation.\n\nThis fix aligns with the solution applied to the assessment creation endpoint, resolving the architectural issue of using client-side Supabase client in server-side operations. The next step is to test the complete assessment flow from start to survey submission, and through to report generation.\n</info added on 2025-05-30T00:58:14.657Z>",
