Create Next.js project using create-next-app:\n   ```\n   npx create-next-app@latest .\n   ```\n   - Choose \"Yes\" for TypeScript\n   - Choose \"Yes\" for using App Router\n   - Select other options as needed (e.g., ESLint, Tailwind CSS)\n\n2. After project creation, review and adjust the generated files:\n   - Ensure `app/` directory is present (indicating App Router usage)\n   - Check `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration\n   - Verify `package.json` for correct dependencies and scripts\n\n3. Make initial commit with the new Next.js setup:\n   ```\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Initial Next.js setup with App Router and TypeScript\"\n   ```\n\n4. Test the setup by running the development server:\n   ```\n   npm run dev\n   ```\n   Verify that the app starts without errors and the default Next.js page loads in the browser.\n</info added on 2025-05-26T17:27:42.881Z>",
