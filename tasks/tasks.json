Interview stakeholders to understand reporting needs and workflow requirements.\n<info added on 2025-05-26T21:08:54.952Z>\nBased on the codebase analysis and requirements analysis findings, we need to update our entity-relationship modeling approach. Here are the key updates:\n\n1. Revise the core entities to reflect the current implementation:\n   - user_profiles (with auth integration)\n   - practices (including branding fields)\n   - children (linked to user_profiles)\n   - assessments (with step-based data)\n   - reports (linked to assessments)\n   - email_campaigns\n   - email_subscribers\n\n2. Address schema variations:\n   - Merge practice_branding into practices table\n   - Update assessment model to use step-based JSON data instead of separate survey_responses\n   - Adjust children and reports relationships\n\n3. Evaluate the need for missing tables:\n   - report_shares for viral tracking\n   - email_sends for detailed email tracking\n   - email_templates for template system\n   - practice_analytics for analytics/reporting\n   - survey_question_definitions for dynamic survey config\n\n4. Incorporate existing database functions into the model:\n   - calculate_brain_o_meter_score\n   - generate_share_token\n   - get_practice_stats\n\n5. Address critical gaps:\n   - Design viral tracking system\n   - Enhance email system with detailed tracking\n   - Plan analytics and reporting infrastructure\n   - Reconcile survey system approach (step-based vs. survey_responses)\n\n6. Consider architectural decisions:\n   - Evaluate current step-based assessment approach vs. survey_responses pattern\n   - Determine whether to implement missing tables or adapt documentation\n   - Design comprehensive service layer for all entities\n\n7. Update data relationships, access patterns, and constraints based on the current implementation and identified gaps.\n\n8.

Implement all identified missing tables:\n   - report_shares: For viral tracking and referral analytics\n   - email_sends: To enable detailed email delivery and engagement tracking\n   - email_templates: For managing email templates\n   - practice_analytics: To support comprehensive analytics and reporting\n   - survey_question_definitions: For dynamic survey configuration\n\n3. Design and implement a comprehensive service layer:\n   - Follow patterns established in auth.ts for all entities\n   - Create modular CRUD operations for each table\n   - Implement business logic services\n   - Add proper error handling and validation throughout the service layer\n\n4. Update the entity-relationship model to reflect these architectural decisions:\n   - Revise the assessments entity to include the new survey_responses relationship\n   - Add new entities for report_shares, email_sends, email_templates, practice_analytics, and survey_question_definitions\n   - Update relationships, access patterns, and constraints to align with the new structure\n\n5. Develop a detailed migration strategy:\n   - Design the new schema incorporating the survey_responses approach\n   - Create step-by-step migration scripts to transition existing data\n   - Plan for a phased rollout to ensure system stability during the transition\n\n6. Update functional requirements documentation to reflect the new architecture and data model\n\n7.

The service is implemented as a singleton PDFService class with methods for client-side and server-side PDF generation, download link creation, data validation, size estimation, and testing.\n\nKey features implemented include professional PDF styling with Helvetica font family, responsive layout, practice branding support, patient information section, Brain-O-Meter score display, summary section, assessment details by category, recommendations section, and footer with report metadata.\n\nThe service integrates seamlessly with existing Report and ReportWithShares types, is exported through the services barrel file, and a test API endpoint has been created at /api/test-pdf.\n\nValidation tests have confirmed successful TypeScript compilation, proper functioning of the PDF generation test endpoint, correct service export and accessibility. The library is now ready for integration with report data and subsequent tasks such as survey data mapping and chart rendering.\n</info added on 2025-05-27T16:58:25.224Z>",
