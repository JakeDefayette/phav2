      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 15,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the refactoring of demoreport.tsx into granular engineering tasks covering: 1) modularization of presentational and data logic, 2) creation of reusable, parameterized components, 3) integration with Supabase for real-time data, 4) Next.js Server Actions for workflow automation, 5) dynamic report rendering and PDF export, 6) UX enhancements, 7) error handling and validation, 8) performance optimization, 9) documentation, and 10) comprehensive testing. For each, specify the technical deliverables, acceptance criteria, and dependencies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves a full-stack transformation of a static report template into a dynamic, real-time, data-driven reporting system with web and PDF outputs. It requires advanced React refactoring, real-time data integration with Supabase, Next.js 14+ Server Actions, workflow automation, PDF generation, modular architecture, UX improvements, robust error handling, and extensive documentation and testing. The breadth and depth of requirements, cross-cutting concerns, and need for maintainability and scalability place this at the highest end of complexity metrics, warranting further decomposition into at least 15 focused subtasks to ensure clarity, parallelization, and risk mitigation."
