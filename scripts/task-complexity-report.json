      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of a Next.js project repository with modular architecture into detailed subtasks. Include initializing the repository, configuring Next.js with App Router, establishing the modular folder structure (components, hooks, services, utils, types, constants), setting up TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky, configuring Vercel deployment, and implementing Atomic Design principles for the component library.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple interdependent steps: initializing a Next.js project with the latest App Router, designing a scalable modular folder structure, setting up a component library based on Atomic Design, and configuring essential tooling (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky) for code quality. Each step requires careful planning and execution to ensure maintainability and scalability, especially for production-grade applications. The complexity is high due to the breadth of technologies and best practices involved, as well as the need for integration and verification at each stage[1][2][5]."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks such as: requirements analysis, entity-relationship modeling, table creation for each core entity (Practices, Assessments, Reports, Email Campaigns, Users), defining relationships and constraints, implementing the modular data access layer, and writing tests for CRUD operations and constraints.",
      "reasoning": "Designing and implementing a database schema for multiple interrelated entities with constraints and a modular data access layer is a complex task. It involves requirements gathering, schema modeling, normalization, relationship definition, and implementation using Supabase/PostgreSQL. Each entity (Practices, Assessments, Reports, Email Campaigns, Users) requires careful table design and relationship mapping, and the modular data access layer adds architectural complexity. Testing CRUD operations and constraints further increases the scope. Database schema complexity is influenced by the number of entities, relationships, and the need for maintainability and scalability[1][3]."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Core Survey Form Components' task into subtasks covering: 1) Form architecture setup with Formik/Yup, 2) Step 1: Lifestyle Stressors component, 3) Step 2: Symptoms component, 4) Step 3: Contact/Consent component, and 5) Progress indicator and navigation system.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a multi-step form with validation, accessibility requirements, and mobile responsiveness. The complexity comes from managing form state across multiple steps, implementing validation logic, ensuring accessibility, and creating a cohesive user experience. Breaking it into component-specific subtasks following the 3-layer approach (Apollo/Logic/View) would make it more manageable."
