      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of a Next.js project repository with modular architecture into detailed subtasks. Include initializing the repository, configuring Next.js with App Router, establishing the modular folder structure (components, hooks, services, utils, types, constants), setting up TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky, configuring Vercel deployment, and implementing Atomic Design principles for the component library.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple interdependent steps: initializing a Next.js project with the latest App Router, designing a scalable modular folder structure, setting up a component library based on Atomic Design, and configuring essential tooling (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky) for code quality. Each step requires careful planning and execution to ensure maintainability and scalability, especially for production-grade applications. The complexity is high due to the breadth of technologies and best practices involved, as well as the need for integration and verification at each stage[1][2][5]."
