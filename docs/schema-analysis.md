## Required Changes

### Priority 1: Verify and Apply Migrations

1. **Check Migration Status**
   ```sql
   --# PHA-v2 Database Schema Analysis
   ```

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the pha-v2 project implementation against the planned database schema from your documentation, I've identified several significant discrepancies and areas that need attention. While there are comprehensive migration scripts that follow the planned schema closely, the actual TypeScript types and current database state show the implementation has diverged from the original design in both structure and approach.

## Key Finding: Migration Scripts vs Actual Implementation

The project contains well-structured migration scripts (`migration-final.sql`) that closely follow the planned schema. However, the TypeScript types in `database.ts` reveal that the actual database state differs significantly from what the migrations intended to create. This suggests:

1. The migrations may not have been fully applied
2. Additional changes were made outside the migration scripts
3. The TypeScript types were generated from an older database state

## Major Structural Differences

### 1. User Authentication Model (Intentional Change)

The implementation correctly uses Supabase Auth integration instead of the originally planned direct authentication. This is a conscious improvement that provides:

- Better security with Supabase's auth infrastructure
- `user_profiles` table properly extends `auth.users`
- `practices` table has an `owner_id` referencing `user_profiles`

### 2. Assessment Data Structure

**Planned Schema:**

- Normalized structure with `survey_responses` table
- Clean separation between `children` and `assessments`
- `survey_question_definitions` for dynamic surveys

**Current Implementation:**

- Denormalized with `step_1_data`, `step_2_data`, `step_3_data` JSON fields
- Child information embedded in `assessments` table (`child_name`, `child_age`)
- Also has `lifestyle_responses` and `symptoms_responses` JSON fields
- Mixed approach with both normalized and denormalized data

**Impact:** Data redundancy and potential inconsistency issues.

### 3. Missing Core Tables

The migration scripts properly define these tables, but they're missing or incorrectly implemented in the TypeScript types:

- `practice_branding` (merged into `practices` table in migrations, which is correct)
- `email_contacts` (exists as `email_subscribers` but with different structure)
- `email_templates` (defined in migrations but missing from TypeScript types)
- `survey_question_definitions` (exists in both but not properly utilized in the application)

### 4. Enum Type Conflicts

The project has multiple conflicting enum definitions:

**In TypeScript types:**

- `user_role: ['Parent/Guardian', 'Chiropractor']`
- `user_role_enum: ['parent', 'practitioner', 'admin']`
- `app_user_role: ['doctor', 'staff', 'admin']`

**In migrations:**

- `user_role_enum: ('parent', 'practitioner', 'admin')`

This creates confusion and potential runtime errors.

## Specific Implementation Issues

### 1. Data Model Inconsistencies

```typescript
// Current assessments table has redundant fields:
assessments: {
  // Denormalized child data (should be in children table)
  child_name: string | null;
  child_age: number | null;
  child_id: string | null; // Foreign key exists but child data duplicated

  // Multiple response storage approaches
  step_1_data: Json | null; // Legacy?
  step_2_data: Json | null; // Legacy?
  step_3_data: Json | null; // Legacy?
  lifestyle_responses: Json | null; // Current?
  symptoms_responses: Json | null; // Current?
}
```

### 2. Missing Relationships

- `children` table exists but not properly utilized
- `survey_responses` table exists but assessment data stored in JSON fields
- `report_shares` table implemented but missing some planned fields

### 3. Subscription Management

**Planned:**

- Single `subscription_tier` enum field
- Clean tier-based approach

**Current:**

- Multiple subscription fields (`subscription_tier`, `subscription_plan`, `subscription_status`)
- Redundant subscription tracking

## Required Changes

### Priority 1: Synchronize Database with Migration Scripts

1. **Check Migration Status**

   ```sql
   -- Check which tables actually exist
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   ORDER BY table_name;

   -- Check enum types
   SELECT typname FROM pg_type
   WHERE typtype = 'e'
   ORDER BY typname;
   ```

2. **Apply Missing Migrations**

   - Run `migration-final.sql` if not already applied
   - Verify all tables and enums are created

3. **Regenerate TypeScript Types**
   ```bash
   npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/database.ts
   ```

### Priority 2: Fix Data Structure Issues

### Priority 2: Fix Data Structure Issues

1. **Normalize Assessment Data**

   - The TypeScript types show denormalized structure with `step_1_data`, `step_2_data`, `step_3_data`
   - Also has redundant `child_name`, `child_age` directly in assessments
   - Migration scripts correctly define normalized structure
   - Need to migrate existing data to use `children` and `survey_responses` tables properly

2. **Consolidate User Role Enums**

   - Multiple conflicting enum definitions exist
   - Standardize on `user_role_enum` as defined in migrations
   - Update all code references to use consistent values

3. **Remove Redundant Fields**
   - Assessment table has both normalized and denormalized fields
   - Choose one approach and stick with it (normalized is recommended)

### Priority 3: Complete Missing Implementations

1. **Email Templates Table**

   - Defined in migrations but missing from TypeScript types
   - Implement proper email template management

2. **Survey Question Definitions**
   - Table exists but not being used properly
   - Implement dynamic survey system as designed

### Priority 4: Data Migration

1. **Assessment Data Migration**

   ```sql
   -- Example approach to migrate denormalized data
   -- 1. Create children records from assessment data
   INSERT INTO children (parent_id, first_name, date_of_birth, ...)
   SELECT DISTINCT
     up.id as parent_id,
     a.child_name,
     -- Calculate date_of_birth from age
     ...
   FROM assessments a
   JOIN user_profiles up ON up.email = a.parent_email
   WHERE a.child_id IS NULL;

   -- 2. Link assessments to children
   UPDATE assessments a
   SET child_id = c.id
   FROM children c
   WHERE c.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM user_profiles WHERE email = a.parent_email)
     AND c.first_name = a.child_name;

   -- 3. Migrate step_*_data to survey_responses
   -- This requires understanding the JSON structure
   ```

2. **Clean Up Redundant Fields**
   - After migration, remove `child_name`, `child_age` from assessments
   - Remove `step_1_data`, `step_2_data`, `step_3_data`
   - Keep only normalized references

### Priority 3: Performance & Scalability

1. **Add Missing Indexes**

   - Many indexes from planned schema not implemented
   - Critical for performance at scale

2. **Implement Proper Constraints**
   - Unique constraints missing
   - Check constraints not implemented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Audit Current Database State**

   ```bash
   # Generate current schema dump
   pg_dump -s your_database > current_schema.sql

   # Compare with migration-final.sql
   diff migration-final.sql current_schema.sql
   ```

2. **Create Reconciliation Plan**

   - Document which migrations have been applied
   - Identify any manual changes made outside migrations
   - Plan phased approach to align with intended schema

3. **Update Application Code**
   - After schema alignment, regenerate TypeScript types
   - Update all database queries to use normalized structure
   - Fix enum references throughout the codebase

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Verify current database state matches migration scripts
- [ ] Apply any missing migrations
- [ ] Regenerate TypeScript types from database
- [ ] Migrate denormalized assessment data to normalized structure
- [ ] Remove redundant fields from assessments table
- [ ] Standardize enum usage across the application
- [ ] Implement proper usage of survey_question_definitions
- [ ] Add missing indexes for performance
- [ ] Update application code to use normalized data model
- [ ] Test all data access patterns thoroughly

## Summary of Critical Issues

1. **Database State Mismatch**: The TypeScript types don't match the migration scripts, indicating the database may not be in the intended state.

2. **Denormalized Data Structure**: Assessment data is stored in both normalized tables and JSON fields, creating redundancy and potential inconsistencies.

3. **Enum Confusion**: Multiple conflicting enum definitions for user roles that need consolidation.

4. **Unused Tables**: Several properly designed tables (like `survey_question_definitions`) exist but aren't being utilized by the application.

5. **Missing Implementations**: Some tables defined in migrations (like `email_templates`) aren't reflected in the TypeScript types.

The good news is that the migration scripts (`migration-final.sql`) are well-designed and follow the planned schema closely. The primary task is to ensure these migrations are properly applied and that the application code is updated to use the normalized structure correctly.
